# Automata Theory
A repository containing the resources as well as my notes on my self-study of automata theory

Have followed hopcroft and Ulman as the primary reference. With special emphasis to chapters 2, 3, 4, 6. Have also covered parts of chapter 7 (7.2) and 8 (High level reading without delving deeoply into the proofs).
Along with that a few other resources that were helpful have been listed

Topics Explored

* Finite Automata
* Applications of Finite Automata in text search
* Regular Expressions and their equivalence to DFAs
* Pumping Lemma and Closure properties of regular languages
* Pushdown Automata
* Parsing
* Context Free Grammars and pumping lemma for them
* A light sprinkle of turing machine


Incredibly well made video on the standard pumping lemma for DFA proofs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2J5kaf6gjg&pp=ygUecHVtcGluZyBsZW1tYSBleGFtcGxlIHByb2JsZW1z

A Nice reference to just get the initial hang of turing Machines: https://kanchiuniv.ac.in/coursematerials/Maths_course_material_2021-22_Odd&EvenSem/10136-PCC-CS501-5.pdf
